# Howdy!

I'm a business person with an interesting background in engineering and development. Big fan of JS (YEYY!). 

I help Businesses get their products to market while having a clear image on where they are using tech and management.

Half a decade in the ecommerce space as a manager, I worked on managing the day to day operations and managing the media buying operations done at these companies. 

I created a CMS from scratch using Next.JS and React.JS for the internal use of these businesses. Including engineering in the management space.

I share some of that experience on Instagram : (https://instagram.com/menidjell)

I've spoken at events and given workshops all over the country. Mainly about business, tech and ecommerce.
